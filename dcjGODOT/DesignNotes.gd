ToDo list Cribbed from Discord Server:


[10:22 AM]Beanie: Movement
Lighting
Combat
Stat Item
EndGoal 
[10:31 AM]Beanie: *Combat 
We need a shootable weapon for both sides shot in a straight line
Enemies to turn towards the player
Player image to switch to Angry when hit for a few seconds
Item to drop from killing an enemy
Item to replenish Health, changing Health back to full
Player icon to switch to Happy for a few seconds after getting item
Game over from taking too much damage

[6:56 PM]Beanie: If possible:
Idea 1 was, a robotic "wheatly" guiding light, that takes you to the end goal . . . but the duality would be evil robots and good robots. We'd have to code a rail system, code them to follow the player somewhat, backtrack . . . etc.
Red and Blue zones to show light or dark . . . . 
A duality meter on the HUD that drains slower or faster depending on the zone your in
An item to replenish that meter and health. Gained from defeating enemies. . . . 
4 stages in the Duality meter that degrades the character sprite.
The last stage in the Duality meter should inflict damage over time, to give a sense of urgency and a way to die
